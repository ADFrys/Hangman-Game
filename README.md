# Hangman-Game

The Hangman game uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
A random word is selected and shown as blanks. The user has a certain amount of guesses to guess the word. If the word is correctly guessed within the allows number of guesses, the user wins. If not, the user losses. The number of wins/losses are recorded each round and the game refreshes.
